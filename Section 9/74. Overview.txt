Overview
Hi All,

In the next tutorial, we take a closer look at matrices, and how we can use them to position nodes relative to the phone's position. 

To really grasp how these matrices operate, deep linear algebraic understanding is required. Please note that this is not a linear algebra course.  I have tried my best to simplify the explanations to account for all audiences. 

Understanding the core of these matrices is not essential to ARKit app development. If you truly want a deeper understanding, I would invest in a computer graphics course!
