Tips Before Proceeding
As you move forward with the course,

1. Note that ARWorldTrackingSessionConfiguration  is now changed to ARWorldTrackingConfiguration . 

2. If you're having trouble running apps with ARKit. Try:

Cleaning the project (command+shift+k)
Turning computer on and off. 
If that doesn't work, the Xcode installation may be corrupt. In which case,

Uninstall and reinstall Xcode (not the beta version, install the release version)
3. If a white screen shows up when you run ARKit code

Your device is not compatible with ARKit. See iPhone Compatibility in Introduction.
If your device is compatible (according to the chart) and you still get a white screen, try starting a new Xcode project.
