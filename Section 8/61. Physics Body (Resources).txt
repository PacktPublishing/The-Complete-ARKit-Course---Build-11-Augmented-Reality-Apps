Physics Body (Resources)
The Started Xcode Project Floor is Lava is in your resources folder as 0602 Source Code

The Concrete image is in your Resources Folder as assets.zip

The xCode file for Physics Body is in your resources folder as 0701

The code you need from the drawing app (if you choose to simply copy and paste the point of view code) :

        let transform = pointOfView.transform
        let orientation = SCNVector3(-transform.m31,-transform.m32,-transform.m33)
        let location = SCNVector3(transform.m41,transform.m42,transform.m43)
        let currentPositionOfCamera = orientation + location
func +(left: SCNVector3, right: SCNVector3) -> SCNVector3 {
    
    return SCNVector3Make(left.x + right.x, left.y + right.y, left.z + right.z)
    
}
Make sure to clean the project before running it.
