The filtering function :

    func filtered(previousAcceleration: Double, UpdatedAcceleration: Double) -> Double {
    let kfilteringFactor = 0.5
    return UpdatedAcceleration * kfilteringFactor + previousAcceleration * (1-kfilteringFactor)
    }
The Xcode file for Reversing is in the Resources Folder
