(Update) iPhone Compatibility
ARKit apps do not run on simulators! You must run your code on a physical device.

The only devices that support ARKit are:


iPhone 6s and 6s Plus (Some issues may arise)
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
iPhone SE
iPad Pro (9.7, 10.5 or 12.9) – both first-gen and 2nd-gen
iPad (2017)
iPhone 8 and 8 Plus
iPhone X  (Some inconsistencies may arise)
If you don't have one of these devices and don't plan to get one, you can request a refund directly through Udemy up to 30 days after buying this course.
