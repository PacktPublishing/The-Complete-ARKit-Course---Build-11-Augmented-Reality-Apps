3D Models (Resources)
Due to an Xcode update, dragging the spongebob jellyfish from the resources folder will result in file corruption. For that reason I removed the jellyfish from the resources folder. 

You'll have to download it, and drag it your Xcode project as I did in the video. 

The Xcode file is in the zip file 0501.zip.

Make sure to clean the project before running it.
